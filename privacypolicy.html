                    <p class="lead">The following sets forth SPLIT RAFFLES, LLC (“Split” or “our”)’s Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”), which is also incorporated into Split’s Mobile Application End User License Agreement.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Your privacy is very important to Split, and Split is committed to protecting your privacy.  Accordingly, Split provides this Privacy Policy so that you understand how Split collects, uses, and, in certain circumstances, discloses the information that you provide and/or that is automatically provided to Split as a result of your download, installation, and use of Split’s mobile application (“Mobile App”) and/or Split’s website located at www.split-app.com (the “Website”).  This Privacy Policy also explains the steps that Split has taken to secure your personal and financial information.  Finally, this Privacy Policy explains your options regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal and financial information.  By downloading, installing, and using the Mobile App, and/or by visiting the Website, you accept the practices described herein and within the Mobile App EULA.  Split is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any third-party that may be involved in the Mobile App and/or the Website.</p>
                    <h2>How Information is Collected:</h2>
                    <p class="lead">You acknowledge that when you download, install, and/or use the Mobile App, or when you visit the Website, Split may use automatic means (including, for example, cookies and web beacons) to collect, receive, store, process, transmit, and use information about you, your Mobile Device, and about your use of the Mobile App and/or Website.  You also may be required to provide certain information about yourself as a condition to downloading, installing, and/or using the Mobile App or certain of its features or functionality, and the Mobile App may provide you with opportunities to share information about yourself with others.  All information Split collects through or in connection with this Mobile App or Website is subject to this Privacy Policy.  By downloading, installing, using, and/or providing information to or through this Mobile App, or to or through the Website, you consent to all actions taken by Split with respect to your information in compliance with the Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Split collects, receives, stores, processes, transmits, and uses information from and about you in several different ways via its Mobile App and/or its Website:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span class="text-uppercase">Registration and Creation of Account - </span>Before using certain parts of the Mobile App or Website, and before participating in any charitable raffle, you must register as a user and create an account (“Account”).  To create an Account, you will be required to provide certain information, including, but not limited to, your name, e-mail address, mailing address, and cell phone number.  You will also need to create a user name and password.  In order to make payments from your Account, you may need to provide your bank name, bank account number, bank account routing number, and other necessary bank account information, including, but not limited to credit card information.  Maintaining Account security is very important.  You acknowledge that you are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the Account user name and password.  You agree to monitor your Account and notify Split immediately if you believe that an Account user name and/or password have been compromised, or if you suspect unauthorized payments are occurring through your Account.

                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="lead">This personal and financial information is solely used for providing services to you, for verifying your purchases, for billing purposes, for processing transactions, for communicating with you about your purchases, for notifying you of your Account activity, including if you are the winner of any charitable raffle(s), for system administration, for troubleshooting, for customer support, for internal marketing purposes, and for any other purpose that Split discloses to you in the course of providing services to you.  This personal and financial information is also used for the purpose of identifying, preventing, and reporting potentially prohibited, fraudulent, or illegal activities.</p>

Your submissions for these purposes are completely voluntary, so you have a choice whether to participate and disclose information to Split.  Should you choose to submit information in response to these requests, Split may collect and use your name, geographic location, and other information submitted through the Mobile App or the Website and to market Split’s products.

Split will only share this information internally, with its mapping provider, and with any other entity that is required for Split’s provision of this service to you.  You may turn off location-based services at any time by editing your settings on your Mobile Device.
